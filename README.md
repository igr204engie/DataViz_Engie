# DataViz_Engie - Telecom Paris IGR204_Visualisation project

## Overview: 

Dashboard to explore and analyze the performance of the solar farm that we have studied for Engie during our Fil Rouge project. 
This dashboard would feature three different aspects of the data, which would be rendered through three different tabs, on which the user could click to switch from one view to the other.

The three tabs would enable the user to extract different types of information:
- Overview: here the user would explore and navigate through the daily production of a given inverter, along a chosen period.
- Performance compariso : this would be the place where the user could compare the performances of the inverters for a given period.
- Anomalies: this tab will allow the user to visualize the outliers days of a given inverter (or a selection of inverters) during a period of time.
