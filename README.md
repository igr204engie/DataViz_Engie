# DataViz_Engie - Telecom Paris IGR204_Visualisation project

## Overview: 

Dashboard to explore and analyze the performance of the solar farm that we have studied for Engie during our Fil Rouge project. 
This dashboard features three different aspects of the data, which are rendered through three different tabs, on which the user can click to switch from one view to the other.

The three tabs enable the user to extract different types of information:
- Overview: here the user can explore and navigate through the daily production of a given inverter, along a chosen period.
- Performance comparison : this is the place where the user compares the performances of the inverters for a given period.
- Anomalies: this tab allows the user to visualize the outliers days of a given inverter (or a selection of inverters) during a period of time.
